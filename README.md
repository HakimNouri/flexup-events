## Description
This repository is a starting point for a Django application that allows users to create and manage events without the need for logins or emails. The goal is to provide a secure yet streamlined way for event organizers and participants to interact:

- **Organizer** creates events and shares a link with guests.
- **Guests** RSVP (confirm, maybe, or decline) without needing an account.
- **Organizer** has a unique link to edit the event and manage participants.
- **Guests** have a unique link to edit their own responses.

This project serves as:
- A standalone proof of concept for features that may be integrated into the FlexUp application in the future.
- A technical challenge for candidates evaluating how to work with Django and HTMX.

---

## Features
- **No User Accounts or Emails**  
  No login, password, or email verification required.
- **Unique Event and Response Links**  
  Each event and each participant response has a unique, secret link to enable secure editing.
- **Inline Editing**  
  Events and responses can be updated directly from the same page, leveraging HTMX for a smoother user experience.
- **Simple Sharing**  
  Share your event URL anywhere—email, social media, or messaging apps.

## Prerequisites
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.8+ recommended)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (lightweight dependency manager)

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fabrizionastri/flexup-events
   cd flexup-events
   ```
2. **Sync dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```
   This will create and activate a virtual environment and install all required packages.

---

## Running the Application
1. **Start the Django development server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
2. **Access the application**:
   Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) (or the address indicated in your terminal).

## Usage
### 1. Creating a New Event (Organizer)
- Click on **"New event"** in the navigation bar.
- Fill out the form with event details.
- Click **"Create event"**.

You will receive **two links**:
1. **Registration link** (e.g., `events.flexup.org/event/<event_slug>/register`)  
   Share this link with guests.
2. **Admin link** (e.g., `events.flexup.org/event/<event_slug>/admin/<event_admin_code>`)  
   Keep this private; it allows you to edit the event and manage participants.

### 2. Guest RSVP
- When guests follow the **registration link**, they see:
  1. **Event Details** (read-only)
  2. **Responses** (list of participants who have responded, read-only)
  3. **New Response Form** to submit their own RSVP  
     - Possible statuses: **Confirmed**, **Maybe**, or **Declined**  
     - Upon submitting, each guest is given a **unique link** to update their response in the future.

### 3. Organizer/Admin Actions
- Using the **admin link**, the organizer sees:
  1. **Event Details** (in view mode by default, but can toggle edit mode with the edit button)
  2. **Responses** (in view mode by default, but can toggle edit mode with an edit button for each participant)
  3. **New Response Form** (if the organizer wants to add participants on their behalf)  
- Admins only have all the status choices available to them: 
  - the basic ones available to participants: **Confirmed**, **Maybe**, **Declined**
  - additional ones, available only to admins: **Invited**, **Waiting list**

## Technical Details
1. **No Email or User Login**  
   - No user database or password management.
   - No email service integrated.
2. **Single Form Structure**  
   - Event and participant forms can switch between read-only and edit modes using HTMX and JavaScript.
   - The form’s read-only status is controlled by a `data-readonly` attribute and toggled in the browser.
   - The `data-readonly` variable controls:
     - the form's style
     - the input's attributes (disabled, readonly)
     - the visibility of the edit, save and cancel buttons
3. **Unique Links for Edit Authorization**  
   - Only users with the correct unique link can edit event details or participant responses.
   - Both front-end (hiding buttons) and back-end (checking links and IDs) enforce authorization.
